## {{< fa basket-shopping >}} Ingredients

- [ ] Butter -- use unsalted butter to saute onions
- [ ] Yellow onion -- it seems like a ton of onion but it disappears into the soup adding a balanced sweetness
- [ ] Garlic -- you'll need 1 Tbsp minced from about 3 cloves
- [ ] Crushed tomatoes -- with their juice, preferably
- [ ] San Marzano tomatoes Chicken stock -- for the best flavor use homemade chicken broth
- [ ] 1/4 cup fresh basil, plus more to serve. Basil leaves are easily bruised so chop by stacking a bunch of leaves then roll them into a log and cut into thin strips.
- [ ] Sugar -- It's just 1 Tbsp, but necessary to combat the tomato acidity.
- [ ] Black pepper -- start with 1/2 tsp and add more to taste
- [ ] Whipping cream -- adds a creaminess to the soup and offsets acidity.
- [ ] Parmesan cheese -- adds saltiness to the soup and balances acidity. Adding parmesan adds enough salt and I usually don't add more.

## {{< fa kitchen-set >}} Preparation

1. *Saute Aromatics* -- heat a non-reactive pot over medium heat. Melt in 4 Tbsp butter then sautee onions until softened and golden (10-12 min). Add minced garlic and saute another minute.
1. *Make the tomato soup base* -- stir in two 28 oz cans of crushed tomatoes with their juice, your chicken stock, chopped basil, sugar and black pepper. Bring to a boil then reduce heat, partially cover and simmer 10 minutes.
1. *Blend if desired* -- use an immersion blender in the pot or blend in batches using a blender (be careful not to overfill the blender with hot liquid) and return soup to the pot.
1. *Add cream and parmesan* -- stir in the heavy cream and shredded parmesan. Return to a simmer and season to taste if needed.
1. Serve -- ladle into warm bowls and garnish with more parmesan and basil.
